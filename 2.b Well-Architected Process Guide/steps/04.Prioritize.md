# Prioritize the recommendations

After running the assessment and with all the information you also gathered from
the Azure Advisor and other tools, you may end up with a huge list of
recommendations that can contain a few hundred items, depending on how many
pillars you are analyzing.

Now, this is the most important step of the process. You need to prioritize the
recommendations and decide which ones you want to implement first, which are
important for the business and which ones can be implemented later.

## WARP Tools

When you filled the assessment, we asked you to store the results as a `CSV`
file, now it's time to use the [WARP][warp] tool to help us with the
recommendation prioritization. If you have opened the generated `csv` you may
have noticed that there's a ponderation score for each recommendation. This
score is used from a script that will create for you a PowerPoint presentation
with a preliminary selection of the most important recommendations.

Go to the [WARP][warp] website and follow the instructions to download, install
and run the tool.

## The Eissenhower Matrix

Another useful tool to help you prioritize the recommendations is the
[Eisenhower Decisson Matrix][eissenhower_matrix] that divides tasks between
Important and Not important in the `y` axis and Urgent and Not urgent in the `x`
axis. For this specific example, we will modify the axes and call them 
**Business Value** and **Execution Complexity**:

When you have finished these two tasks, continue to the [Roadmap step][5].
