# Security review

A multi-layered approach to securing your environment will increase the security
posture of your environment. Commonly known asÂ defense in depth. You need to
review and protect all the layers (from deep to surface):

[![Defense in Depth][defenseindepth]][2defenseindepth]

1. Data: avoid data access vulnerabilities
2. Application: malicious code injection and other common attacks.
3. Infrastructure: malware, credential exposure and lateral movements
protection.
4. Network: unnecessary open ports, brute-force attacks.
5. Perimeter: DoS attacks
6. Policies and access: monitoring, use of modern authentication methods.
7. Physical: unauthorized access to facilities.

Increasing the security of your workload, may probably increase your Azure
bill, but you also need to calculate the huge costs of a security breach. Today,
the cost of not applying security mechanisms goes beyond the trust of loss or
the cost of repairing the aftermath. Malicius actors are using many techniques
to take control of full subscriptions where they will deploy costly resources to
serve their needs.

## Level 1 - Identity and Encryption

How are **authentication and authorization** managed for the resources? What
**protocols** are in use? Are you applying **MFA**? Are you using **Managed
Identities**?

Check if you are using correctly RBAC with the least access principle, and have
controls in place to access your Azure resources.

List the encryption requirements at the different application levels.

## Level 2 - Networking, Secrets and Tools

Review how the network perimeter is being protected (e.g. use of NSGs, Bastion,
end-to-end encryption, etc). Check the use of Firewalls and Gateways.

Verify the proper usage of Keys, Secrets and Certificates. Lifecycle management
of keys, and the access policies applied.

List the tools and processes used for monitoring, auditing and detecting
vulnerabilities.

## Level 3 - Application level security

Many vulnerabilities start in the workload code. Review the Development
Lifecycle of the application and ensure that [DevSecOps][devsecops] principles
are applied, using automated code scanning and vulnerability assessment tools.

Check that the deployments are automated to avoid human errors.

How are users authenticated and authorized to access the application?

Do regular Threat Modelling sessions with the development team. Do

## Checkpoint

* [ ] Most important security risks identified ([Threat matrix][threatmatrix]).
* [ ] Effort evaluation for optimizations related to security.
* [ ] Trade-offs, costs and potential cost of a security breach.

Now you can move to the next pillar: [Reliability][3.C]
