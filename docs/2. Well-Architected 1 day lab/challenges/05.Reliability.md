Time: 60-90 minutes

## Assignment

Analyze the provided information and answer these questions:

* How will you provide an SLA in excess of 99.95% (per month) for the overall claims application? Consider all application tiers: web, DB, DC. Consider an IaaS approach.
* How can you improve the reliability for the Contoso branch office VPN connections?
* Are your VMs and databases covered from data corruption or accidental deletion?.
* How will you monitor and alert on your resources?
* How can the PaaS implementation achieve an equivalent level of resiliency?

## Success Criteria

* Reliability recommendations to be implemented
* High level architecture of the IaaS deployment with your recommendations
* High level architecture with a PaaS design
* Estimation of your solutions SLA
