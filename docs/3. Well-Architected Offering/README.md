### Offer listing

Remember to create a name with the format “Name: duration – type”, you will usually create one with a name like “Well-Architected: n-day assessment”. In the Offer listing it is important to have a detailed description, and it is recommended to include an agenda when it is a multi-day event. Add also examples of the deliverables of the assessment or workshop that you will deliver to the customer.

Set the duration accordingly:

And carefully review the materials and supporting documents you are uploading.

### Co-Sell with Microsoft

This section is extremely important to allow us to nominate the listing as a CAF/WAF offering. You should mark “Microsoft Azure” as the platform, define Service as the Solution Type and add the Well Architected solution areas that you will cover.
