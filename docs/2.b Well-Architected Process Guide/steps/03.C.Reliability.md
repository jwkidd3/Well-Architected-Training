# Reliability review

When reviewing the Reliability pillar you typically start with the business
requirements of the application. Try to ask the questions:

* How critical is the application?
* What would happen if the application went down?
* Is it a custom solution or provided by a software vendor?
* What are the SLAs targets?
* Does the customer have a risk analysis?

## Level 1 - Composite SLA, SPOF and HA

The first thing is to identify the type of architecture you are looking at, for
example:

* Is it a hybrid solution?
* Does it support/implement global distribution?
* Is the database deployed with distributed availability?
* What is the main
workload of the application for (IoT, Data Analytics, Web)?

With the Architecture Diagram at hand, you need to identify the **Single Point Of
Failure** this architecture may suffer, and then
[calculate the composite SLA][sla-calc] for the whole solution.

To audit SPOF, see how the architecture can respond to failures by using
load-balancing, scalesets, stateless services, etc. Check if application
resiliency is tested using any Chaos Engineering techniques.

Discuss about the High Availability requirements and see how is the application
prepared for HA.

Calculate the cost implications of adding HA, but also the potential cost of
application downtime and data loss.

## Level 2 - BCDR, Detection & Response

Review the backup strategy and disaster recovery plan, and check if these are
tested regularly.

Check what are the [RPO and RTO][rporto] constraints for this solution:

![RPO RTO][rporto-img]

Discuss what are the Disaster Recovery plan triggers, what health checks are in
place, how the system is monitored and what alerts are configured. Is there any
traffic routing in place in the case of a general failure?

## Level 3 - Design Patterns

There are several design patterns that can be used to improve reliability of the
workload. Check with the development team if they are used in the architecture:

* [Retry pattern and Fallback][retry]
* [Timeout][timeout]
* [Circuit Breaker][circuit-breaker]
* [Rate Limiting][rate-limiting]
* [Bulkhead][bulkhead] or [Shared-nothing][shared-nothing] architecture
## Resources

* [BCDR][bcdr]
* [Composite SLA][sla]
* [Single Point of Failure][spof]
* [Reliability checklist][reliability-checklist]

## Checkpoint

* [ ] Most important SPOF identified.
* [ ] Composite SLA calculated.
* [ ] Disaster recovery plan.

Now you can move to the next pillar: [Performance][3.D]
