# The analysis phase

During this phase you will analyze the data you gathered and analyze in depth
the current architecture characteristics of the workload to identify the most
important recommendations to apply to improve the architecture.

You will find in the next guides a layered approach to analyze the architecture,
with different levels of detail depending on the depth you need of this
analysis.

You can go directly to the pillars you decided in the scoping phase:

* [Cost Optimization][3.A]
* [Security][3.B]
* [Reliability][3.C]
* [Performance Efficiency][3.D]
* [Operational Excellence][3.E]
