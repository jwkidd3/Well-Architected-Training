# Operational Excellence review

Operational excellence is about ensuring that you have full visibility into how
your application is running, and ensuring the best experience for your users.
The most important topics when looking into the operational excellence are:

1. DevOps and continuous integration in mind
1. Use of monitoring and analytics to gain operational insights
1. Apply automation to reduce effort and errors
1. Test everything

Try to answer these questions:

* How would you optimize application time to market?
* What manual processes are still in place? How would you automate them?
* Could PaaS improve the operations?
* Would you change anything in the current monitoring set up? Why?
* What changes would you introduce in the deployment?
* Is the architecture prepared for the unexpected and to catch mistakes?

## Level 1 - Monitoring, Organization and Deployment

When we talk about operations, the most important aspect is having the [right
monitoring in place][operations-checklist]. Identify the key **metrics**, which
logs are you monitoring and what kind of dashboarding and alerts you are using.
Having a resource dependencies map will be very helpful too.

Review the resource organization and naming conventions being used, and how are
them followed and/or enforced. Review at subscription, management group and
tenant levels. This information should have come out during the discovery phase
with the subscription walkthrough and the [CCO Dashboard][ccodashboard].

Then you can review the deployment, what is the current deployment strategy, and
what automation tools are being used for it. Does the deployment has a rollback
process? Are Infra-as-Code and [configuration management][app-configuration]
used?

## Level 2 - Testing

To ensure that everything will run as expected you need to test everything
before deploying into production. For sure, you need **unit tests** and **code
coverage** metrics during your development cycle, but you also need to run
**integration tests** as soon as possible in your cycle.

A main tenet of a DevOps practice to achieve system reliability is the shift
left principle.

If your process for developing and deploying an application is depicted as a
series of steps that are listed from left to right, your [testing should be
shifted][shift-left] as much as possible toward the beginning of your process
(e.g. to the left), and not just at the very end of your process (e.g. to the
right).

## Level 3 - BCDR

This is again about the BCDR strategy discussed in the Reliability pillar:

Review the backup strategy and disaster recovery plan, and check if these are
tested regularly.

Check what are the [RPO and RTO][rporto] constraints for this solution:

![RPO RTO][rporto-img]

Discuss what are the Disaster Recovery plan triggers, what health checks are in
place, how the system is monitored and what alerts are configured. Is there any
traffic routing in place in the case of a general failure?
