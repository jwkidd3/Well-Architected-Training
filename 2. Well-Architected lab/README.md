Welcome to the Well-Architected lab. This is a full-day hands-on experience
where you will be given a set of challenges to practice the skills you learnt
in the
[Well-Architected Workshop](https://github.com/microsoft/GPS-Well-Architected-Partner-Training/tree/main/1.%20Well-Architected%20Workshop).

In this lab you have to review the architecture of the Contoso Inc. Insurance
company and provide a roadmap of recommendations based on the Well-Architected
principles.

## Case Study

Contoso Inc., is an Insurance Company headquartered in Madrid, provides
insurance solutions across Europe.

* **Mobile agents** located across the continent visit claimants to verify their
claims and upload information using the Claims Application.
* Headquarters is in Madrid, Spain with various **branch locations**.
* Contoso IT group is a classic shop, mainly focused on infrastructure, **little
automation** in operations.
They use **legacy tools** for monitoring, governance, security and deployments.
* The **AppDev department’s skill set is dated**, predominantly focused on
client/server development.
* The organization has an **Internet-based claims application** they recently
deployed into Azure.
* The current design relies on a single SQL Server VM and a single AD VM. Web
servers use a load-balancer with TCP probe.
Branch offices are connected to Azure using Site-to-Site VPNs with on-site RRAS
server.
* Customers have reported **reliability issues** with the claims application.
Failures were correlated to **service health issues with the SQL VM**.
* **Network connectivity** issues between the branch offices and the corporate
office have occurred intermittently. Every time there is a failure in
connectivity, IT team needs to travel to the branch office to troubleshoot on
site.
* Disk storage has a heightened level of attention due to a critical server
running out of disk space, highlighting gaps in proactive monitoring.
* Recent stability issues with the claims application prompted Contoso to
perform a business impact analysis of the application.
* The result is an executive mandate **to achieve an SLA of at least 99.95%**
for the claims application, with RTO of 4 hours and RPO of 6 hours, plus backup
of all critical VMs and data.
* The App Dev team is working on a **next-generation PaaS-based implementation**
of the claims application. This is based on a Web App and Azure SQL Database.
* The need to achieve a similar level of resilience as the IaaS-based version,
otherwise the business will not agree to migrate to PaaS.
* They need to improve in the application’s time to market as competition in the
industry is fierce, **they need to implement automation** not only for their
infrastructure provisioning but also for code deployment. They only have a
pipeline for production code deployment.
* As they plan on to moving to PaaS they need to **modernize their day-2
operational toolset**.
* Security is a big concern as their deployment is internet facing and
distributed. They need to **design their system securely** both in the cloud and
branch offices.
* The insurance industry is subject to regulatory standards that they need to
align to and provide the mechanisms to **enforce compliance guidelines** as well
as provide auditing information when requested.
* Cost is a concern; they need to **optimize their current spending** with the
IaaS design before planning for the next-gen PaaS deployment.

### Customer Architecture

Currently have a single domain controller deployed in West Europe. Connectivity
is enabled with a site-to-site VPN gateway.

![General architecture](support%20materials/arch1.png "There are two VPN tunnels to connect to Azure, one with headquarters and another one with the Branch office  ")

The claims application has this characteristics:

* Web servers deployed into an availability set
* SQL Server backend
(single VM)
* GRS Storage account for object storage
* Azure Bastion is deployed to manage the VM access.
* West Europe

![Claims application](support%20materials/arch2.png "The claims application is deployed in West Europe, with a single VM running a single SQL Server. ")

This architecture can be deployed (without the actual application) with the
provided template:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazure.svg?sanitize=true)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FGPS-Well-Architected-Partner-Training%2Fmain%2F2.%2520Well-Architected%25201%2520day%2520lab%2Fazuredeploy.json)

> ⚠️ This deployment may cost over **$5000/month**,
so take care to set limits to your Azure consumption in the subscription
and to stop or delete all the deployed resources to avoid high costs.

### Additional facts

* Development Environment uses the same size VMs and settings as Production.
* AppDev team only access the environment 9:00-17:00 Monday through Friday.
* All services are deployed in pay-as-you-go mode.
* Platform doesn’t use any WAF but NSG are configured. Claims Apps has not been
configured SSL, yet.
* There is no up/down autoscaling set up.
* Any new version of the application is deployed manually. For monitoring they
use an agent-based 3rd party tool for the infrastructure metrics, there is no
APM. No security or governance solution implemented. They use Azure Backup.
* There is a mismatch of the expected consumption for the deployed resources and
what they are being charged. They do not know where those charges may be coming
from.

#### Customer concerns and objections

* After merging with another company, the customer is struggling to provide a good service from their claims app to their mobile agents.
* They need to provide redundancy and resiliency to deliver 99.95% SLA or greater
* Improve the reliability of the VPN
* Guarantee that BCDR and backup solutions are secure and cost effective
* Improve time to market of this app, it is a very competitive scenario and they need to automate deployments and processes
* They started to look into PaaS services but they fear they will be expensive and may not provide the required SLA
* After the merge, they have some disconnected infraestructure and teams, an legacy operational tooling that work in silos
* Need to improve internal structure for cloud operations
* Security and compliance are a big concern, highly regulated industry
* Claims app is exposed to the internet and they need to ensure it is secure
