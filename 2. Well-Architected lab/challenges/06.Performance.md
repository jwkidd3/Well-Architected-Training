Time: 45 minutes

## Assignment

Analyze the architectures you just proposed and explain:

* Can you provide a solution that scales to meet the public demand? How would this solution change in an PaaS architecture?
* How can you improve the performance visibility and alerting? Are all the tiers covered?
* Is there a more proactive approach?
* Is the architecture properly sized? Consider cost analysis to determine how much you can improve.

## Success Criteria

* High level architecture design that is able to meet demand, both IaaS and PaaS
* Description on how your architecture scales
* Metrics and Tooling changes required to support application scalability and design
